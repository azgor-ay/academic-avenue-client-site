# College Booking Web App

## Introduction
Hey there! This is my college booking web app. I used some fancy tech like MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to make it work. It's a place where you can book college services and stuff.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo. You gotta have Node.js and MongoDB on your computer.
2. Run `npm install` to get all the stuff I used.
3. Set up the MongoDB connection string in the server config. It's important, dude.
4. I used Firebase auth for login and stuff, so you gotta set that up too. Firebase is cool!
5. Run `npm start` and you can see the app in your browser. It's kinda awesome!

## Features
I tried my best to add cool features:
- You can search for colleges and check out their deets.
- There are 3 college cards on the home page with cool info like events and sports.
- Click the "Details" button on the cards, and you go to a page with more deets about the college.
- I also have a nice college image gallery. Cool, huh?
- You can see research papers that college students did. Smart folks!
- Oh yeah, there's a review section too. You can read what others say about colleges.

## Tech I Used
- React.js: It's like the heart of the frontend stuff.
- Tailwind CSS: For some styling. Tailwind is pretty rad!
- Node.js & Express: The backend magic.
- MongoDB: To store all the college info and stuff.
- Firebase Auth: For user login and profile things.
